# DailyCodingProblem practice

###### See `problems` for standalone problems without solutions (includes difficulty level).

###### See `solutions` for solutions to the corresponding problem in Python. Some have multiple solutions, typically starting with a brute force or suboptimal solution and ending with a better one. Occasionally, I will skip problems that are vague or are outliers compared to the other problems, or if they simply can't be implemented in Python due to language-related restrictions.

###### `book` will have solutions to problems found in the DailyCodingProblem book.

###### `strat_list` contains a list of commonly-used or helpful strategies that I'll be updating as I go along. Note that many strategies can apply for problems outside of the ones mentioned on the list.
