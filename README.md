# DailyCodingProblem practice

#### See `problems` for standalone problems without solutions (includes difficulty level).

#### See `solutions` for solutions to the corresponding problem in Python. Some have multiple solutions, typically starting with a brute force or suboptimal solution and ending with a better one.

#### `book` will have solutions to problems found in the DailyCodingProblem book.

#### `strat_list` contains a list of commonly-used or helpful strategies that I'll be updating as I go along. Note that many strategies can apply for problems outside of the ones mentioned on the list.
